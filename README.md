# ElectionAnalysis

## Project Overview
We need to analyze the election with the followign task.

1. Calculate the total votes
2. Get the list of candidate received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate
4. Calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate
5. Determine the winner
6. Calculate the vote for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes for each county.
8. Determine the county with highest turnout rate.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python, 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.54.3

## Election-Audit Results
The analysis of the election show that:
-There are total 369,711 votes
-The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diane DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  -Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  -Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  -Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
  -Diane DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
- The counties were:
  - Jefferson
  - Denver
  - Arapahoe
- The result were:
  - Jefferson County received 10.5% of the vote and 38,855 number of votes.
  - Denveer County received 82.80% of the vote and 306,055 number of votes
  - Arapahoe County received 6.7% of the vote and 24,801 number of votes,
-The result was Denver with the highest turnout rate
  
## Election-Audit Summary
1. We can use the same code to run analysis for another set of election data. We need to change the resouces and output files.
2. We can modified te cde to analyize election fiel by age or by gender group.

## Challenge
I just start to learn the terms of Python and still trying to figure out how it is used in the writing the code.
